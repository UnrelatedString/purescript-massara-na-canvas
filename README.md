# my-purescript-template
Just a couple things it would be nice not to have to copy so much for new projects!

Note to others: this includes a non-version-locked link to my personalized Spec reporter which is liable to change at any time. I'm leaving this repository public in case anyone might find it instructive, but I would recommend forking it and forking or otherwise replacing my Spec reporter rather than directly using it as a template for your own projects.
